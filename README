Business/PayPal version 0.03
============================

This module attempts to make the automation of PayPal transactions as simple
as Credit Card transactions currently are.  This should allow PayPal to be
used in places it currently can not, such as online software sales, services
for immediate consumption, and in my particular case, conference registrations.
To this end, the module includes methods for creating PayPal buttons, of any
desired complexity, and methods for validating the Instant Payment Notification
messages that PayPal sends when a payment is made.
