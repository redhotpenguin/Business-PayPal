=head1 NAME

Business::PayPal - Perl extension for automating PayPal transactions

=head1 ABSTRACT

Business::PayPal makes the automation of PayPal transactions as simple
as doing credit card transactions through a regular processor.  It includes
methods for creating PayPal buttons and for validating the Instant Payment
Notification that is sent when PayPal processes a payment.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To generate a PayPal button for use on your site
Include something like the following in your CGI

  use Business::PayPal;
  my $paypal = Business::PayPal->new;
  my $button = $paypal->button(
      business => 'dr@dursec.com',
      item_name => 'CanSecWest Registration Example',
      return => 'http://www.cansecwest.com/return.cgi',
      cancel_return => 'http://www.cansecwest.com/cancel.cgi',
      amount => '1600.00',
      quantity => 1,
      notify_url => http://www.cansecwest.com/ipn.cgi
  );
  my $id = $paypal->id;

Store $id somewhere so we can get it back again later

Store current context with $id.

Print button to the browser.

Note, button is an HTML form, already enclosed in <form></form> tags



To validate the Instant Payment Notification from PayPal for the
button used above include something like the following in your
'notify_url' CGI.

  use CGI;
  my $query = CGI->new;
  my %query = $query->Vars;
  my $id = $query{custom};
  my $paypal = Business::PayPal->new(id => $id);
  my ($txnstatus, $reason) = $paypal->ipnvalidate(\%query);
  die "PayPal failed: $reason" unless $txnstatus;
  my $money = $query{payment_gross};
  my $paystatus = $query{payment_status};

check if paystatus eq 'Completed'
check if $money is the ammount you expected
save payment status information to store as $id


To tell the user if their payment succeeded or not, use something like
the following in the CGI pointed to by the 'return' parameter in your
PayPal button.

  use CGI;
  my $query = CGI->new;
  my $id = $query{custom};

  #get payment status from store for $id
  #return payment status to customer


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 new()

Creates a new Business::PayPal object, it can take the
following parameters:

=over 2

=item id

The Business::PayPal object id, if not specified a new
id will be created using md5_hex(rand())

=item address

The address of PayPal's payment server, currently:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr

=item cert

The x509 certificate for I<address>, see source for default

=item certcontent

The contents of the x509 certificate I<cert>, see source for
default

=back

=head2 id()

Returns the id for the Business::PayPal object.

=head2 button()

Returns the HTML for a PayPal button.  It takes a large number of
parameters, which control the look and function of the button, some
of which are required and some of which have defaults.  They are
as follows:

=over 2

=item cmd

required, defaults to '_ext-enter'

This allows the user information to be pre-filled in.
You should never need to specify this, as the default should
work fine.

=item redirect_cmd

required, defaults to '_xclick'

This allows the user information to be pre-filled in.
You should never need to specify this, as the default should
work fine.

=item button_image

required, defaults to:

    CGI::image_button(-name => 'submit',
                      -src  => 'http://images.paypal.com/x-click-but01.gif'
                      -alt  => 'Make payments with PayPal',
                     )

You may wish to change this if the button is on an https page
so as to avoid the browser warnings about insecure content on a
secure page.
